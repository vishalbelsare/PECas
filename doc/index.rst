PECas - Parameter Estimation using CasADi
=========================================

PECas holds a user-friendly environment for solving parameter estimation problems and for interpretation of the results received. It does so by providing Python classes that can be initialized with the problem specifications, while the computations can then easily be performed by using the available class functions.

As it's name suggests, PECas makes use of the optimization framework
`CasADi <http://casadi.org>`_ to solve parameter estimation problems.

In the following sections, you will receive the information necessary to obtain,
install and use PECas. If you encounter any errors using this software, please feel free
to submit your error with a description of how it occurred to adrian.buerger@hs-karlsruhe.de.

**Please note:** PECas is still in it's testing state, and does not yet contain all the features it will provide in future versions. Therefore, you should check for updates on a regular basis.
