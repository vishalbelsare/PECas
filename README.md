PECas - Parameter estimation using CasADi
=========================================

PECas holds a user-friendly environment for solving parameter estimation
problems and for interpretation of the results recieved. It does so by
providing a Python class that can be initialized with the problem
specifiations, so that the computations can be performed using class functions.

As it's name suggests, PECas makes use of the optimization framework
`CasADi <https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki>`_ to solve parameter estimation
problems.

In order to use PECas, please make sure that Python as well as Python Numpy
and a recent version of CasADi are installed on your system. PECas has been 
run only on Linux systems so far, and has not been tested for Windows.

For a tutorial on how to use PECas and a detailed documentation, please
visit `the manual pages <http://adbuerger.github.io/>`_ .
