PECas
=====

Parameter estimation using CasADi
---------------------------------

PECas holds a user-friendly environment for solving parameter estimation
problems and for interpretation of the results recieved. It does so by
providing a Python class that can be initialized with the problem
specifiations, while the computations are then easily performed using
class functions.

As it's name suggests, PECas makes use of the optimization framework
[CasADi](https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki) to solve parameter estimation
problems.

**Please note:** PECas is still in it's testing state, and does not yet contain all the features it will provide in future versions. Therefore, you should check for updates on a regular basis.

For an installation guide, a tutorial on how to use PECas and
a detailed documentation, please
