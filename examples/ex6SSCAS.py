#  ex6.py: Example 6 shows how to estimate the parameters of a general system
#          described by an ODE with no analitical solution. To create a model
#          that the solver can handle, a single shooting approach using the
#          integrator class from casadi is used. Furthermore, the example
#          illustrates a parametric identification where two different kind of
#          measurements (angle and angular speed) are used, which have
#          different standar deviation.
#          The particular system is a pendulum, with a manuver as the actuator,
#          and a torsional spring attaching the pendulum to the manuver. The
#          problem tries to estimate the spring constant, and initial velocity
#          and pendulum angle.

# and for the sake of accuracy, the Casadi integrator class is used. The
# integrator solves an initial value problem defined by a differential
# algebraic equation (DAE).

# requires as a input. The DAE input/output scheme of Casadi is used to

# Defining the Casadi integrator. The integrator has different plugins (cvodes,

# of the type casadi.casadi_core.MX to evaluate the sparsity, both (Model and
# variable Theta have to be also of type casadi.casadi_core.MX).
#       - Theta: matches the parameter structure used before to define the
#        input of the ODE, [phi0,w0,K]
#       - Model: storages the simulated values of the integrator at the
#        different times steps. Since it contains both, angular speed and
#        rotational angle values it must be formatted in a particular way,
#        [phi0,phi1.....,phiN,w0,w1,.......,wN].T

# In a iterative fashion, the different discrete states X(k) = [phi(k), w(k)] 
# are obtained. For that, we use the Casadi integrator function, which 
# integrates the ODE of the system on a small time step Î”T, taking as initial
# state X(k-1) and ending at X(k). IThe first state has to be the unknown
# the X(t=0) = [phi0,w0] = [Theta[0], Theta[1]] that will be estimated.
# Using the Casadi integrator input scheme, the 2 required inputs are defined:
#     - x0: representing the integration initial state. It is the state at the 
#     previous time step, thus, x0 = X(k-1). x0 has to be of type 
#     casadi.casadi_core.MX, and of shape equal to the shape of xs (since xs 
#     represented the state on the ODE definition).
#     - p: the parameters of the ODE, and in turn, they have to take
#     take the value of Theta. Note that since only the spring constant K
#     appears explicitly in the ODE, the parameter vector ps (ps was the
#     variable defining the parameters on the ODE definition)  as well this 
#     input p could have been defined as ps = p = [K] = Theta[2], instead of 
#     the current [phi0,w0,k]. However, to use a single terminology por the 
#     estimated parameters, they can be all included in a single vector without 
#     any difference.The input p is also of type casadi.casadi_core.MX, and of 
#     shape equal to ps. 
# To obtain the different X(k), the value of the variable X is iteratively
# reassigned, and its value moved to the vector containing the Model.
